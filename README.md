FYI: You can only register and login, because DB was not part of the project. Some of the functions will be not reachable. For testing I previously used a local sqlite DB.

A prototype of a mobile app is to be developed for the coordination of an operational task by the trainees from all locations of our company. This should be able to run on the Android operating system. All user data and important information for the tasks should be saved locally on a relational SQL database. This was also used for authentication, data changes and tests. In the company, the trainees are distributed in different teams and can be constantly involved in different activities. Each team is responsible for a specific area, e.g. technology, trade fair, software and marketing team. Each trainee should be assigned to at least one team and regularly contribute his / her part to this team. The idea of this application is based on the Kanban method. The tasks should be organized in three different states - open, in progress and completed. See the picture below.
